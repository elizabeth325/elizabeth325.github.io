# Professional Self-Assessment

This ePortfolio gave me a chance to rapidly increase the level of performance of many of my technical skills. It is a showcase of some of the best work that I have completed over the last four years. However, it is also a demonstration of where my skills currently are because I spent the last two months improving my previously existing projects. Over the course of this term, I have grown capable of making informed decisions regarding my career goals. 

The artifacts that I compiled demonstrate my skill with Software Development, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I completed one enhancement for each of those categories. I also completed a code review covering the entirety of the capstone plan and narratives for each artifact. These taught me a lot about technical communication which is a key component for collaborating with team members and communicating with stakeholders. My assessment of each project shows that my skills extend beyond just an ability to complete the code. I have a true understanding of the subject matter.

All three of my enhancements were based on a project that I did for my Mobile Architecture and Development class. It was an event-tracking app. For my Software Design and Engineering artifact, I added a setting that allowed the user to customize the color theme of the app. Personally, I find many colors to be very harsh on the eyes, so I thought that this enhancement would greatly improve the user experience because it allows each user to choose how they want the app to look. It shows my ability to work with flexible design and prioritize the aspect of an app that promote user engagement. 

My Algorithms and Data Structures artifact addressed inefficiency. The original displayed the events by calling directly to the database. I adjusted the code to call to the database once and place the events into a collection. From there they are displayed to the user. Instead of the database being written to every time the user adds, updates, or deletes an event, the collection is merely be edited. The database is only written to once the user selects a button to save their changes. This greatly improves efficiency and demonstrates my skills in working with data structures and my knowledge of how computer hardware interacts with them.

The final artifact focuses on databases. For this one, I addressed a major problem in my app. The class the I originally wrote the app for required that the app have a login capability but not that the app be tailored to meet each user. Once logged in all of the users could see all of the events that anyone had entered. They could even edit or delete other usersâ€™ events. This is obviously a huge privacy and security issue. I altered this so that the app now only displays the events that are tied to each user. This involved changing how the database worked and changing much of the code that handled interacting with the database. This artifact very directly showcases that I am capable of working with databases at a professional level.



# Code Review

Before starting work on any of my enhancements, I did a code review that walks through the current code and the planned improvements.
