			<p>For as long as there have been stories, there have been great heroes to star in them.  The greatest heroes of western literature are those of King Arthur’s court.  King Arthur and his knights have been the heroes of many people’s imaginations.  Among these great knights was Sir Gawain, the legendary nephew of King Arthur.</p>
			<p>Because he has been written about by so many authors, scholars can study him for years and still not know everything about him. However, many people want to become familiar with him without devoting their entire lives to it. 	When one is attempting to get to know Gawain, it is important to remember that there are many versions with their own unique spins on his character.  With that in mind, here are some of the essential texts in the history of the great Sir Gawain.</p>

						<dd>The stories of Arthur and his court swiftly crossed the channel into France where a man named Chretien de Troyes popularized them throughout the continent and helped shape Gawain into the man we know today.</dd>

					<dt><a href="./english.html">English Texts</a></dt>
						<dd>Gawain gained his sea-saw reputation in the hands of English authors. Due to the sheer number of English books staring him, he has been portayed as anywhere from perfect knight to idle bore. Many avid fans find much of this work contraversial, but, if one seeks to understand Gawain, England cannot be overlooked as it makes up the majority of his history.</dd>

				<div>
					<dt><a href="./german.html">German Texts</a></dt>
						<dd>Most people associate King Arthur most heavily with England, Wales, and, if they know something about its history, France. However, the middle ages saw Arthurian stories written in Italy, Portugal, Holland, and many more countries. Germany in particular produced several important texts about The Round Table and most especially about Gawain.</dd>
